# Powers

You can set powers with their descriptions on your character.

`powers <name>` - Lists traits for a character.
`powers/set <title>=<description>` - Sets a power.
`powers/rem <title>` - Removes a power.

Admins with the `manage\_apps` permission can set other peoples' traits:

`powers/rem <name>=<title>`
`powers/set <name>=<title>/<description>`
