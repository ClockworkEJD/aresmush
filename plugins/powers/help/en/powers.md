# Powers

You can set powers with their descriptions on your character.

`powers <name>` - Lists powers for a character.
`powers/set <title>=<description>` - Sets a power.
`powers/rem <title>` - Removes a power.

Admins with the `manage_apps` permission can set other peoples' powers:

`powers/rem <name>=<title>` - Removes a power from another character.
`powers/set <name>=<title>/<description>` - Sets a power on another character.
